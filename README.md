# 🎈 I'm 1tzArad but you can call me Arad


I started programming three years ago, but I still can't call myself a developer. I began by making Discord bots with JavaScript. Later, I moved to web development and chose PHP for the backend. Until recently, I was working with PHP and writing Discord bots in JavaScript. Now, I have been using JavaScript for web development for a few months!

I've been on Discord for a few years now and have created a bunch of Discord servers, but none of them were really successful. I still haven't been able to make an active Discord server. But if you have an idea for a server, I’m totally in!

## 🚀 What do I do, anyway?

### **Simple Discord Bots**

* I have a strong interest in creating Discord bots. Since I'm not very experienced yet, I can’t make high-quality, advanced bots. However, I can definitely write a suitable bot for a simple Discord server!

### Website Backend

* When I was choosing my path in programming, I decided to focus on the backend. I'm currently starting to work with JavaScript for backend development, but I haven't reached my desired level yet.
