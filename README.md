# I'm 1tzArad but you can call me Arad

I'm Arad, a random 15-year-old who's just getting into programming.

I started programming three years ago, but I still can't call myself a developer. I began by making Discord bots with JavaScript. Later, I moved to web development and chose PHP for the backend. Until recently, I was working with PHP and writing Discord bots in JavaScript. Now, I have been using JavaScript for web development for a few months!

I've been on Discord for a few years now and have created a bunch of Discord servers, but none of them were really successful. I still haven't been able to make an active Discord server. But if you have an idea for a server, I‚Äôm totally in!

# What do I do, anyway?
